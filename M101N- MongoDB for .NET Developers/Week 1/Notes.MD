- Non relational. Does not store data in tables. Documents can have a hierarchy
- Tables have no hierarchy by default, so it's not an easy task to save/query a complex aggregation root. A transaction required to persist single aggregation root into multiple tables.
- collections(tables)
- In Mongo - document persistence is an atomic transaction
- Stores json documents
- http://json.org/
- Easy to program
- Schemaless. Implicit schema defined by application
- Schemaless allows to persist misc inheritance scenarios, like different type loan contracts with different fields, etc. No need to hassle with table iheritance patterns.

- db.things.save({"key","value"})
- db.things.find().pretty()
- _id ObjecId
- findone, update property, save
